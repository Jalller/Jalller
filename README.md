Jalller Public
Where I break things, fix them again, and make it look intentional 💻✨



## 👋 Hi, I’m Jalller! 👋

🎯 **A little about me**

🎓 Professional code breaker. Also a student — **Software Development** - Third semester.  
💻 Backend enthusiast with a strong focus on **Java**, **APIs**, and **database design** — full-stack is the goal, but backend is where I shine.  
🧩 Somewhere between “I got this” and Googling how to center a div (but mostly backend stuff).  
🌱 Currently leveling up in frontend (because apparently that’s a thing now) — but backend will always be my first love.  

---

🛠️ **Tech I've been hands-on with lately**
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Java, Javalin, JPA, Hibernate, Lombok, Spring Boot
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL  
- **DevOps-ish:** Docker, GitHub Actions  
- **Other familiar faces:** Git, Markdown, IntelliJ, Postman  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, React (beginner)


> ...and probably more that I’ve repressed for memory space 🧠💥

Let’s be real: most devs are just one quick Google away from looking like geniuses anyway._

🚀 **Next up?**
- Survive frontend  
- Build something cool  
- Maybe feel like less of an imposter

### 💡 Fun facts / currently into:
- Learning: React, cat communication, and how CSS is still a mystery  
- Breaks builds and bakes cookies (sometimes simultaneously) 🍪
- I also question my life choices while scrolling through error logs and talk to my cat about debug errors. It’s a system.
- Backend Adventures: Debugging Java errors, refactoring Javalin routes, and figuring out why PostgreSQL won’t connect.
- Forgetting one Java annotation and spiraling — it’s tradition at this point

# 🌀 Still figuring it out. Still showing up.
*Currently building a new portfolio of personal projects — focused on quality, clean code, and actual documentation  
(no more half-finished school assignments, promise).*
